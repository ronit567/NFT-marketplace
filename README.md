Drawing inspiration from Opensea, I envisioned developing my unique NFT marketplace intricately linked to my decentralized bank. This platform empowers users to seamlessly engage in buying, selling, posting, and managing their NFTs. Leveraging React as the foundation for the Dapp, and utilizing the dynamic capabilities of the ICP live blockchain, I aim to create an immersive and secure environment for NFT enthusiasts to explore, transact, and curate their digital assets.
